# ULTRASONIC SECURITY SYSTEM
---
## Abstruct
This project is an ultrasonic based security alarm. It is distance sensitive, so the buzzer beeps faster if the object is near and it beeps slowly if the object is far. This is a simple alarm system made with help of buzzer, LED and an Ultrasonic sensor also known as Proximity/Distance Sensor (HC-SR04). One can stop the buzzer by pressing the button.

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
HLR1- The buzzer should be on if the object detects, HLR2- The distance should be measured, HLR3- The servo motor performs the function of a radar, HLR4- The distance should be measured, HLR5- If the object detects the servo motor should stop otherwise it keeps on rotating.

## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
LLR1- The servo motor should rotates continuously between 0 and 180 degrees, LLR2- The system should alert the user when an object detects, LLR3- The corresponding distance of the object from the sensor should be displayed on the LCD screen,

## SWOT ANALYSIS

### STRENTHS
* It provides security to the system.
* it can be easily implemented everywhere.
* It is affordable and confortable to use.

### WEAKNESS
* It always require power supply to operate
* Lot of wires create messy in the hardware system.

### OPPORTUNITIES
* It is easily Implemented within the another system to get the security.
* By adding extra security it can be used everywhere.
* Wireless Technology

### THREATS
* The unstable power supply, fire could be considered as a threat
* Humidity in the rooms housing the hardware.
* Lightning, flood, earthquakes etc.

Home
Institute
Office
Others Security System

### WHEN
When there is a requirement of security in Home,Institute and other secure region.

### WHO
It is for those who need security for their properties.

### HOW
