# ULTRASONIC SECURITY SYSTEM
---
## Abstruct
This project is an ultrasonic based security alarm. It is distance sensitive, so the buzzer beeps faster if the object is near and it beeps slowly if the object is far. This is a simple alarm system made with help of buzzer, LED and an Ultrasonic sensor also known as Proximity/Distance Sensor (HC-SR04). One can stop the buzzer by pressing the button.

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
HLR1- The buzzer should be on if the object detects, HLR2- The distance should be measured, HLR3- The servo motor performs the function of a radar, HLR4- The distance should be measured, HLR5- If the object detects the servo motor should stop otherwise it keeps on rotating.

## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
LLR1- The servo motor should rotates continuously between 0 and 180 degrees, LLR2- The system should alert the user when an object detects, LLR3- The corresponding distance of the object from the sensor should be displayed on the LCD screen,

## SWOT ANALYSIS

### STRENTHS
* It provides security to the system.
* it can be easily implemented everywhere.
* It is affordable and confortable to use.

### WEAKNESS
* It always require power supply to operate
* Lot of wires create messy in the hardware system.

### OPPORTUNITIES
* It is easily Implemented within the another system to get the security.
* By adding extra security it can be used everywhere.
* Wireless Technology

### THREATS
* The unstable power supply, fire could be considered as a threat
* Humidity in the rooms housing the hardware.
* Lightning, flood, earthquakes etc.

## COMPONENTS REQUIRED

### ARDUINO UNO
The Arduino/Genuino Uno microcontroller board is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. There are 14 digital input/output pins (six of which can be used as PWM outputs), six analogue inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button on the board.
In this project an arduino uno is used to interface all the periferals.
### LCD
LCD is a display and LCD's have a backlight, and pixels are turned on and off electronically by rotating polarized light with liquid crystals.
In this project LCD is used to display the distance from the sensor to the object.
### SERVO MOTOR
In this project servo motor is used to allow the sensor to move and cover 180-degree
A servo motor is a self-contained electrical device that rotates machine parts with high precision and efficiency.
### ULTRASONIC SENSOR
In this project an ultrasonic sensor is used to sense the object
An ultrasonic sensor is a piece of electronic equipment that produces ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal in order to detect the distance between a target item and the sensor.
### ADC
Only analogue voltage values can be converted into digital values by an ADC. So, whatever parameter we want to monitor, it must first be translated into voltage, which may be accomplished with the help of sensors.
n this project ADC is used to convert sensor data to digital data
### POTENTIOMETER
In this project potentiometer is used to act like an object for the ultrasonic sensor
A potentiometer is a voltage divider that consists of a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or revolving contact.It operates as a variable resistor or rheostat when only two terminals, one end and the wiper, are employed.
### BUZZUR
It is an electric signaling device that makes a buzzing sound.
In this project the buzzer is used to alert the user.
