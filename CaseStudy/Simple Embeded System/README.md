SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM

Components Required:
* GSM Module : It's a module for cellular communication. It stands for worldwide mobile communication system. The GSM Module is made up of three parts: a mobile station, a base station, and a network subsystem. The GSM Module is utilised to deliver SMS notifications and also assists the user in overriding the system manually.

* Arduino UNO R3 : Arduino is an open source physical processing platform that includes a microcontroller board and a development environment for programming the board. It receives a few inputs, such as switches or sensors, and monitors a few numerous outputs, such as lights, the engine, and so on. In contrast to most microcontroller frameworks, Arduino is a cross-platform app since its programmes may run on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems.

* Flying Fish MH Sensor : This is a very inexpensive analogue board with a comparator and a pot that outputs both analogue and digital signals.

* Relay Module : This is a 2-channel 5V, 10A relay interface board. It's possible. used to manage a variety of appliances and other devices a strong current

* DC Motor : Any of a group of rotating electrical machines that transform direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy is known as a DC motor. The most common varieties rely on magnetic fields to produce forces. Two DC motors were used to provide two pumps for water flow.

* Water Level Sensing Circuit : A water level sensor circuit was constructed using an Arduino UNO, two 10 kilo-ohm resistors, a bread board, jumper wires, and a 5V DC supply. It's used to check the amount of water in a tank.

REQUIREMENTS

High Level Requirements
* Crop irrigation schedule on a daily basis.
* It irrigates at various levels of wetness.
* One of the most significant features is irrigation.
* It conserves water.

Low Level Requirements
* The system will automatically activate when the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold.
* When the crop requires water, the system will provide it.
* The water level is also checked by the system.
* he system measures the moisture content of the soil using the soil moisture level sensor.

APPLICATION
* Fields
* Forms
* Gardens...etc
